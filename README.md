HexChat-Mock
============

A HexChat mocking library. This is a drop-in "hexchat.py" Python module working with both, Python 2 and 3, which will allow code autocompletion features to work in editors that support it. The module also includes the official HexChat Python plugin API docstrings and does some basic error checking for the usage of the plugin API where possible.
